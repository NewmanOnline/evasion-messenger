        Introduction
        ============
        
        This is a core dependancy of the deviceaccess, director and any
        project who needs access to the event system.
        
        Development
        ===========
        
        To develop this project change into the messenger folder and then
        do the following command::
        
        python setup.py develop
        
        
        This will set the messenger's path up allowing you to run it without
        neededing to set up the PYTHONPATH.
